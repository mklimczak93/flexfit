## Terms of Use


Last Updated August 31, 2022


Welcome to FlexFit! These Terms of Use ("Terms") are a contract between you and FlexFit USA LLC ("FlexFit" or "we") and govern your access to and use of any FlexFit website, mobile application (such as for iPhone or Android) or content (the "Site") or any fitness, recreational, wellness, or other classes, experiences, activities, events, services, recordings, and/or products made available through FlexFit (collectively, "Classes"). Please read these Terms carefully before accessing and/or using the Site and/or Classes.


THESE TERMS CONTAIN A BINDING ARBITRATION AGREEMENT AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER THAT REQUIRE YOU TO ARBITRATE ALL DISPUTES YOU HAVE WITH CLASS PASS ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS. PLEASE SEE SECTION 18 FOR MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER. YOU EXPRESSLY AGREE THAT DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND FlexFit WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION, AND YOU HEREBY WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT OR CLASS WIDE ARBITRATION.


### 1. Terms of Use.


a. Acceptance of Terms. By accessing and/or using the Site and/or Classes, or clicking any button to indicate your consent, you accept and agree to be bound by these Terms, just as if you had agreed to these Terms in writing. If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use the Site or any Classes.


b. Amendment of Terms. FlexFit may amend the Terms from time to time. Unless we provide a delayed effective date, all amendments will be effective upon posting of such updated Terms. Your continued access to or use of the Site or Classes after such posting constitutes your consent to be bound by the Terms, as amended.


c. Additional Terms. In addition to these Terms, certain plans, offers, products, services, elements or features may also be subject to additional terms, conditions guidelines or rules which may be posted, communicated or modified by us or applicable third parties at any time. Your use of any such plan, offer, product, service, element or feature is subject to those additional terms and conditions, which are hereby incorporated by reference into the Terms, provided that in the event of any conflict between such additional terms and the Terms, the Terms shall control. The FlexFit Privacy Policy is hereby incorporated by reference.


### 2. FlexFit Platform


a. FlexFit Platform. The FlexFit platform enables consumers to reserve, schedule, purchase, access and attend a wide range of fitness, recreational and wellness Classes offered and operated by fitness studios, gyms, trainers, venues or other third parties (collectively, "Venues"). FlexFit itself is not a gymnasium, place of amusement or recreation, health club, facility, fitness studio or similar establishment and does not own, operate or control any of the Classes that are offered at or through such facilities.


b. Membership Options. There are a number of ways to participate in Classes through FlexFit, such as various subscription plans, promotional plans, digital Classes, and non-subscription purchases. These options consist of different classes, services and features and may be subject to additional and differing conditions, prices, policies and limitations. We reserve the right to modify, terminate or otherwise amend our offered options and plans at any time in our discretion. From time to time we may permit non-subscribers to access certain Classes, content or features for a cost or at no cost. FlexFit makes no commitment on the quantity, availability, type or frequency at which such Classes, content and features will be available to non-subscribers and may modify, discontinue, remove or suspend access at any time and for any reason in our sole discretion.


c. Subscription Plans. To enjoy full access to the Site and Classes, you need to sign up for a subscription. A subscription starts on the date that you sign up for a subscription and submit payment via a valid Payment Method (defined below. or reactivate a pre-existing subscription. Unless we otherwise communicate a different time period to you at the time of sign up or otherwise (such as a multi-month commitment plan), each billing cycle is one month in length (a "Subscription Cycle"). Your FlexFit subscription automatically renews each month, and we will automatically bill the monthly subscription fee to your Payment Method each month, until your subscription is cancelled or terminated. For example, if you purchase your FlexFit subscription on April 5, your subscription will automatically renew on May 5 (as further explained in "Subscription Cycles," below). You must provide us with a current, valid, accepted method of payment ("Payment Method"). We may update the accepted methods from time to times. If you add a subscription to your base subscription or if you upgrade or downgrade to a different subscription, all such subscriptions will be governed by these Terms and will continue indefinitely until canceled or terminated.


d. Use of Credits. Depending on the subscription plan you choose and purchase, you will be allotted credits to be used solely to book Classes each Subscription Cycle. You can choose how you use your credits across the various Classes available to you.


Credits expire at the end of each Subscription Cycle, meaning that any credits you don’t use during the applicable Subscription Cycle will not roll over into future months, unless we expressly communicate otherwise. You can find more information about the current rollover policies here. You can see how many days you have left in each Subscription Cycle in your account settings. If your subscription is canceled or terminated your unused credits will expire immediately. There will be no refund or payment for any unused amount. When your cycle automatically renews for the next month, you’ll automatically receive your new allotment of credits. If you have any questions about how to use your credits, please contact us and we can help you.


Credits have no cash value or any other value outside of the FlexFit platform and are not redeemable for cash. For the avoidance of doubt, the credits do not operate or serve as stored value facilities in any way. You may not transfer, trade, gift or otherwise exchange FlexFit credits. Note that separate from credits, you can also buy a gift certificate. Gift certificates and credits are not the same thing. Our gift certificates are called "gift cards". Unlike credits, gift cards never expire. Gift cards are discussed further in Section 4(b) below.


e. Class Availability and Allocation. The exact number and type of Classes you take during any Subscription Cycle will depend on the number of credits needed to book the particular Classes you select. The number of credits needed to book a particular Class will vary and is determined based on a variety of factors, including but not limited to Venue requirements, time of day, equipment, facilities, the number of times you’ve visited a studio in the cycle, location, pricing, popularity and other characteristics. For example, a Class offered at a peak time is likely to require more credits to book than the same Class offered in the middle of the afternoon. Or, a Class that uses equipment is likely to require more credits to book than a class without the use of any equipment. Furthermore, a Venue may require more credits for a certain Class under certain circumstances, such as when the Venue makes only a small number of spots available to FlexFit or after multiple visits in a cycle. Note that credits needed to book Classes also vary from city to city. Accordingly, if FlexFit permits you to reserve classes in a city that differs from your home location, your credits may enable you to reserve more or fewer classes when you are traveling from your home location. As such, the number of credits you need to reserve a particular Class or service may change at any time or vary day to day depending on the factors described here. FlexFit also reserves the right to change the number of credits you receive, including per cycle, plan, geography or otherwise; the number of reservations you can make; and/or the number of Classes you can miss or cancel.


FlexFit does not guarantee the availability of particular Venues, locations, Classes, services, experiences, content, inventory, spots or other features, and availability may change over time and at any time (including during the course of any given Subscription Cycle). The type, quantity, credits, allocation and availability of Venues, classes, and other inventory offered, are determined by FlexFit in its sole discretion. FlexFit takes certain steps to release, promote and otherwise make available spots and inventory at varying times and in an ongoing and evolving way.


f. Digital Classes. FlexFit may allow you to access to a variety of audio or video Digital Classes from your computer or mobile device, via live stream and/or on demand. To access these digital Classes, you need to comply with certain technical and hardware requirements. Certain digital classes may involve your participation through connected devices such as heart rate monitors. If you participate in such digital Classes through a connected device, we may collect heart rate and other metrics (e.g., points) to calculate your ranking in a Class leaderboard (if you sync your heart rate monitor to the Site), display a record of your participation, and otherwise provide, learn about and improve the Site and our services. If you sync your heart rate monitor with the Site to participate in digital Classes, you will automatically be part of the leaderboard experience, and other participants in the class will see your profile information (including your profile picture and username) and rank in the class. Additionally, your profile information may appear on our Site and be viewable by other FlexFit users. For example, FlexFit may show a weekly leaderboard displaying the profiles of the ten users who have the highest cumulative point totals for the week. If you do not want your profile picture or username to be seen by other FlexFit users, don’t include any identifying information in your profile, or go to your settings to change it. FlexFit is not responsible for the accuracy of the heart rate monitor used in connection with the digital Classes. The heart rate recommendations and goals provided through these digital Classes may not be right for you and it is solely your responsibility to make sure that you participate in the manner and at the intensity level that is right for you.


g. Non-Subscription Purchases. FlexFit may permit you to purchase certain products or Classes through the Site, in addition to your subscription or without having a subscription. You acknowledge and agree that these Terms apply to any such purchase you make, and you will be responsible to pay the applicable fees, which may change at any time.


h. Co-Memberships. From time to time FlexFit may permit you to sign up for a co-membership that provides you with a membership to FlexFit as well as a membership to a third-party Venue, such as a gym ("Venue Membership"). If you sign up for a co-membership, you will be subject to these Terms as well as additional terms applicable to the co-membership and the Venue Membership. You understand and agree that FlexFit does not own, operate or control the Venue Membership and is not responsible for the Venue Membership, which is provided entirely by the applicable Venue.


i) FlexFit Account. Your FlexFit account is personal to you and you agree not to create more than one account. You cannot transfer or gift Classes or credits to third parties or allow third parties to use your FlexFit account, including other FlexFit users. You must not use or exploit the Site and/or Classes for commercial purposes. We continually update and test various aspects of the FlexFit platform. We reserve the right to, and by using the Site and/or Classes you agree that we may, include you in or exclude you from these tests without notice. You understand and agree that FlexFit may take actions we deem reasonably necessary to prevent fraud and abuse.


You agree that the information you provide to FlexFit at sign up and at all other times will be true, accurate, current, and complete and that you will keep this information accurate and up-to-date at all times. When you sign up, you will be asked to create a password. You are solely responsible for all activity that occurs under your account, including any activity by unauthorized users. To use the Site you must have access to the Internet and may be required to download a FlexFit mobile application to use some or all of FlexFit features. You are solely responsible for providing your own access (e.g., computer, mobile device, Internet connection, etc.) to the Site and Classes.


j. Eligibility. The availability of all or part of our Site and/or Classes may be limited based on geographic, age, or other criteria as we may establish from time to time. You understand and agree we may disallow you from subscribing to FlexFit or may terminate your subscription at any time based on these criteria. For example, you must be 18 years of age or older to use the Site and/or Classes and/or purchase a FlexFit subscription. You further understand that the Site and/or Classes may not be available in every geography.

PLEASE ENSURE THAT YOU ARE VIEWING THE TERMS OF USE FOR THE COUNTRY IN WHICH YOU ARE LOCATED: USA | GBR | CAN | AUS | NZL | SGP | UAE | MYS | THA | HKG | PHL | IDN | IND.


THESE TERMS ARE ONLY APPLICABLE TO USERS IN THE U.S. THE SITE IS NOT AVAILABLE TO ANY USERS SUSPENDED OR REMOVED FROM THE SITE BY FlexFit. BY USING THE SITE, YOU REPRESENT THAT YOU ARE A RESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, AT LEAST 18 YEARS OLD AND HAVE NOT BEEN PREVIOUSLY SUSPENDED OR REMOVED.

### 3. Fees, Billing, Cancellation


a. Recurring Billing. By initiating a FlexFit subscription, you authorize us to charge you for your initial subscription period and a recurring monthly subscription fee at the then current rate, which may change from time to time. You acknowledge that the amount billed each month may vary for reasons that may include differing amounts due to promotional offers and/or changing or adding a plan, and you authorize us to charge your Payment Method for such varying amounts, which may be billed monthly in one or more charges. You also authorize us to charge you any other fees you may incur in connection with your use of the Site, such as any applicable sign-up fee, taxes and cancellation or late fees, as further explained below. Note that even if you do not use the subscription or access the Site and/or Classes, you will be responsible for subscription fees until you cancel your subscription, or it is otherwise terminated.


b. Subscription Cycle. When you sign up and purchase your FlexFit subscription, your first Subscription Cycle will be billed immediately. Unless we expressly communicate otherwise, your subscription will automatically renew each month and you will be billed on the same date each month. We reserve the right to change the timing of our billing (and if we do, we’ll make adjustments to the amounts we charge, as appropriate). In the event your paid subscription began on a day not contained in a given month, we may bill your Payment Method on a day in the applicable month or such other day as we deem appropriate. For example, if you started your FlexFit membership or became a paying member on January 31st, your next payment date is likely to be February 28th, and your Payment Method would be billed on that date. Your renewal date may change due to changes in your subscription.


c. Refunds. Generally, our fees (including the monthly fee for your membership and any other fees) are nonrefundable unless we specifically communicate otherwise at the time of purchase. However, we will provide a refund to subscribers for their current prepaid subscription period only in the following circumstances: (i) if you are canceling your subscription and request a refund within 5 days of the date of your first payment for your subscription or (ii) if your subscription is cancelled prior to the end of a period for which you have incurred a charge, due to your relocation, disability or death; provided, however, in each case we reserve the right to charge a fee to cover the cost of any class or other services or products you may have used or received prior to your cancellation and to ask for proof of such changed condition, to the extent permitted by law. WE DO NOT PROVIDE REFUNDS OR MAKE GOODS FOR ANY PRIOR MONTHS INCLUDING FOR UNUSED CREDITS OR CLASSES.


d. Price Changes. We reserve the right to adjust pricing at any time. Unless we expressly communicate otherwise, any price changes to your subscription will take effect on your next billing cycle upon notice communicated through a posting on the FlexFit website or mobile applicable or such other means as we may deem appropriate from time to time, such as email. If you do not cancel your subscription, you will be deemed to have accepted these new fees.


e. Payment Methods. You may edit your Payment Method information by logging onto our website or mobile app and editing it in your account settings. If a payment is not successfully settled due to expiration, insufficient funds or otherwise, you nonetheless will remain responsible for any uncollected amounts and authorize us to continue billing the Payment Method or any other payment method you have provided, as it may be updated, including in the event you attempt to create a new account, reactivate the unsettled account or sign up for a new account. This may result in a change to your payment billing dates. If we cannot charge your account, we reserve the right, but are not obligated, to terminate your access to our Site or any portion thereof.


f. Cancellation of Subscription. Unless we communicate otherwise, you may terminate your subscription at any time before your subscription renews by going into your account settings on the FlexFit website and letting us know you would like to cancel. Unless we communicate otherwise, and except for during a Trial, following any cancellation you will continue to have access to your subscription through the end of your current prepaid Subscription Cycle, unless you cancel and receive a refund in which case your access will be terminated immediately. Note that if you do terminate your subscription, we reserve the right to charge a reactivation fee if you want to return to FlexFit in future months or to restrict your access in future months. If you cancel your subscription or it is terminated for any reason, you will lose access to all Classes, content, credits or features available through the subscription.


g. Other Fees. You are responsible for paying applicable fees if you do not cancel a Class you had reserved with appropriate notice or do not attend your scheduled Class. Click here for our current cancellation and missed Class rules, including the applicable fees. We reserve the right to change the policy regarding when we charge fees, to introduce additional fees (such as a sign-up fee) and to change the amount of any such fees at any time.


h. Reservation and Cancellation of Classes. As a FlexFit user, you must reserve and cancel your Classes only through the Site. It is a breach of these Terms if you reserve or cancel directly with a Venue, including through any online or mobile account you have with a Venue, independent of FlexFit. If you reserve or cancel directly with such Venue, we reserve the right to charge you the full amount that the Venue charges for such class and/or any applicable cancellation fees, and/or to suspend or terminate your subscription.


i. Fees Charged by Venues. In addition to fees we charge, Venues may also charge equipment or other amenity fees that you will be responsible for directly. For example, some Venues might charge extra to rent a yoga mat or cycling shoes. Further, FlexFit only gives you access to the class for which you signed up on the Site (and at the specified time and location). The Venue may have additional fees for use of additional classes or spaces.


j. Third Party Fees for Using FlexFit. You are also responsible for all third-party charges and fees associated with connecting to and using the Site and/or Classes, including fees such as internet service provider fees, telephone and computer equipment charges, sales tax and any other fees necessary to access the Site and/or Classes.


### 4. Promotions


a. Trials. From time to time we may offer a trial membership that includes access to the FlexFit platform during the trial period. The Classes, content and features available during your Trial may differ from those available during subsequent Subscription Cycles. Trials will have the duration and price communicated at the time you sign up. Unless otherwise communicated, a trial begins at the moment of sign up (even if you choose not to take your first Class until a later date) and ends at 11:59pm ET on the last day of the trial (for a one-week trial, this would be the same weekday of following week). If you cancel your Trial, your cancellation will be processed and your Trial period will end immediately, your credits will expire, and your upcoming reservations will be cancelled, unless we communicate otherwise. Each trial membership automatically will convert to a regular monthly subscription and price unless canceled by 12pm ET on the day before the last day of trial. Customers that cancel and do not convert to a regular subscription may not attend classes taking place after the end of the trial membership period (even if booking occurred before the end of the applicable trial period). Trials, discount offers, and promotions (collectively "Trials") may be redeemed as described in the specifics of the promotion and may be subject to additional or different terms. Unless we expressly communicate otherwise, Trials are not transferable, may not be combined with other offers or redeemed for cash and are void where prohibited. You understand and agree that unless we expressly communicate otherwise, Trials are available only to new users that have never had a FlexFit account before and there is only one Trial permitted per credit card or payment method and it is a violation of these Terms to sign up for a Trial if you have signed up for an account or trial in the past or to have more than one account or trial at the same time. FlexFit reserves the right, in its absolute discretion, to determine your eligibility for a Trial. If in our discretion we believe you are not eligible for a Trial, we reserve the right to prevent you from signing up for a Trial or to terminate your promotional subscription. If we terminate your Trials because you have violated these Terms, you understand that you will not be eligible for a refund.


b. Gift Cards. From time to time we may make available gift cards for FlexFit membership. The current terms that apply to gift cards can be found here. Other than gifting a gift card as described in the gift card terms, you may not gift Experience or credits to the third parties and your use of FlexFit is personal to you.


c. Refer a Friend. From time to time we may make available certain incentives for FlexFit users to refer a friend to use FlexFit. The current terms that apply to referrals can be found here.


d. Other Promotions. FlexFit may offer additional types of offers and promotions which will be subject to additional terms and conditions that FlexFit may provide.


### 5. Termination or Modification by FlexFit.


You understand and agree that, at any time and without prior notice FlexFit may (1) terminate, cancel, deactivate, disable, delete and/or suspend your subscription, your account, any orders placed, or your access to or use of the Site, your membership and/or Classes (or any portion thereof, including but not limited to your access to any or all Venues, credits or classes or services) and/or (2) discontinue, disable, suspend, modify or alter any aspect, feature or policy of the Site , including of your subscription. This includes the right to terminate or modify any subscription prior to the end of any pre-paid or committed period. Upon any termination or otherwise, we may immediately deactivate your account and all related information and/or bar any further access to your account information and the Site. FlexFit shall have no liability for, and you shall have no recourse for, any such termination or deactivation, except as set forth in the following sentence. If you are subscriber, then upon any such termination by us without cause, as your sole recourse, we will issue you a pro rata refund of the prepaid portion of your subscription applicable to future unused services (less any fees or costs for classes or services already used). If we determine that you have violated these Terms or otherwise engaged in illegal or improper use of your membership, Classes and/or the Site, you will not be entitled to any refund and you agree that we will not be responsible to pay any such refund. You agree that FlexFit will not be liable to you or any third party for any termination or modification to the service regardless of the reason for such termination or modification. You acknowledge that your only right with respect to any dissatisfaction with any modification or discontinuation of service made by us is to cancel or terminate your subscription. If FlexFit deletes your account for these reasons, you may not re-register for or use the Site and/or Classes under any other user name, email, payment method or profile. FlexFit may block your access to the Site to prevent re-registration.


### 6. Privacy.


Your privacy is important to FlexFit. The FlexFit Privacy Policy is hereby incorporated into these Terms by reference. Please read the privacy policy carefully for information relating to FlexFit’ collection, use, and disclosure of your personal information. When you make a reservation, the applicable Venue partner will have access to certain information about you, such as your name and email address, so it can process the applicable reservation or activity and make available Classes and provide services to you.

### 18. Arbitration Agreement


PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING CAREFULLY:


a. Purpose. This Arbitration Agreement facilitates the prompt and efficient resolution of any disputes that may arise between you and FlexFit. Arbitration is a form of private dispute resolution in which parties to a contract agree to submit their disputes and potential disputes to a neutral third person (called an arbitrator) for a binding decision, instead of having such dispute(s) decided in a lawsuit, in court, by a judge or jury trial.


Please read this Arbitration Agreement carefully. It provides that all disputes between you and FlexFit shall be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration replaces the right to go to court. In the absence of this arbitration agreement, you may otherwise have a right or opportunity to bring claims in a court, before a judge or jury, and/or to participate in or be represented in a case filed in court by others (including, but not limited to, class actions). Entering into this Arbitration Agreement constitutes a waiver of your right to litigate claims in court and all opportunity to be heard by a judge or jury. There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. The arbitrator must follow this Arbitration Agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorney’s fees).


For the purpose of this Arbitration Agreement, "FlexFit" means FlexFit and its parents, subsidiaries, and affiliated companies, and each of their respective officers, directors, employees, and agents. The term "Dispute" means any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and FlexFit regarding any aspect of your relationship with FlexFit, whether based in contract, statute, regulation, ordinance, tort (including, but not limited to, fraud, misrepresentation, fraudulent inducement, negligence, gross negligence or reckless behavior), or any other legal or equitable theory, and includes the validity, enforceability or scope of this Arbitration Agreement (with the exception of the enforceability of the Class Action Waiver clause below). "Dispute" is to be given the broadest possible meaning that will be enforced.


WE EACH AGREE THAT, EXCEPT AS PROVIDED BELOW, ANY AND ALL DISPUTES, AS DEFINED ABOVE, WHETHER PRESENTLY IN EXISTENCE OR BASED ON ACTS OR OMISSIONS IN THE PAST OR IN THE FUTURE, WILL BE RESOLVED EXCLUSIVELY AND FINALLY BY BINDING ARBITRATION RATHER THAN IN COURT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT.


b. Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution. Before initiating any Dispute, whether in court or arbitration, you must first give FlexFit an opportunity to resolve the Dispute by mailing written notification to FlexFit, Legal Department, 4051 Broad Street, San Luis Obispo, CA, 93401. That written notification must include (1) your name, (2) your address, (3) a written description of the Dispute, and (4) a description of the specific relief you seek. If FlexFit does not resolve the Dispute to your satisfaction within 45 days after it receives your written notification, you may pursue your Dispute in arbitration.


c. Arbitration Procedures. If the Dispute is not resolved as provided above in the Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution section, either you or FlexFit may initiate arbitration proceedings. The American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), www.adr.org, or JAMS, www.jamsadr.com, will arbitrate all Disputes, and the arbitration will be conducted before a single arbitrator. The arbitration shall be commenced as an individual arbitration, and shall in no event be commenced as a class arbitration. All issues shall be for the arbitrator to decide, including the scope of this Arbitration Agreement. For arbitration before the AAA, for Disputes in which less than $75,000 is at issue, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes will apply; for Disputes involving $75,000 or more, the AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules will apply. In either instance, the AAA’s Optional Rules For Emergency Measures Of Protection shall apply. The AAA rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. For arbitration before JAMS, the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules & Procedures and the JAMS Recommended Arbitration Discovery Protocols For Domestic, Commercial Cases will apply. The JAMS rules are available at www.jamsadr.com or by calling 1-800-352-5267. In the event that this Arbitration Agreement conflicts with the applicable arbitration rules, this Arbitration Agreement shall govern. Under no circumstances will class action procedures or rules apply to the arbitration. Because your contract with FlexFit, the Terms of Use, and this this Arbitration Agreement concern interstate commerce, the Federal Arbitration Act ("FAA") governs the arbitrability of all Disputes. However, the arbitrator will apply applicable substantive law consistent with the FAA and the applicable statute of limitations or condition precedent to suit.


d. Arbitration Award. The arbitrator may award on an individual basis any relief that would be available pursuant to applicable law, and will not have the power to award relief to, against or for the benefit of any person who is not a party to the proceeding. The arbitrator shall make any award in writing but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by a party. Such award by the arbitrator will be final and binding on the parties, except for any right of appeal provided by applicable federal law, including but not limited to the Federal Arbitration Act ("the FAA"), and may be entered in any court having jurisdiction over the parties for purposes of enforcement.


e. Location of Arbitration. Arbitration shall take place in New York County, New York, but it may proceed by telephone if you so choose.


f. Payment of Arbitration Fees and Costs. FlexFit will pay all arbitration filing fees and arbitrator’s costs and expenses upon your written request given prior to the commencement of the arbitration. You are responsible for all additional fees and costs that you incur in the arbitration, including, but not limited to, attorneys or expert witnesses. Fees and costs may be awarded as provided pursuant to applicable law.


g. Class Action Waiver. Any Disputes arising out of or relating to your use of the Site and/or attendance at, participation in or use of Classes, any purchase you make on or through the Site, any information you provide via the Site, and/or these Terms (including the formation, performance, or alleged breach), shall be submitted individually by you and will not be subject to any class action or representative status. The arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a class or representative proceeding or claims (such as a class action, representative action, consolidated action or private attorney general action) . Neither you, nor any other Member of FlexFit and/or user of FlexFit services, can be a class representative, class member, or otherwise participate in a class, representative, consolidated or private attorney general proceeding with respect to the matters set forth in the first sentence of this paragraph. You agree that this Class Action Waiver is material and essential to the arbitration of any dispute between you and FlexFit and is non-severable from the Arbitration Agreement. If any portion of this Class Action Waiver is limited, voided, or cannot be enforced, then the Arbitration Agreement shall be null and void. You understand that by agreeing to this Class Action Waiver, you may only pursue Dispute against FlexFit in an individual capacity and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action or representative proceeding.


h. Limitation of Procedural Rights. You understand and agree that, by entering into this Arbitration Agreement, you and FlexFit are each agreeing to arbitration instead of the right to a trial before a judge or jury in a public court. In the absence of this Arbitration Agreement, you and FlexFit might otherwise have a right or opportunity to bring Disputes in a court, before a judge or jury, and/or to participate or be represented in a case filed in court by others (including class actions). By using the FlexFit Site or any Class, product or services, or otherwise accepting these Terms, you are entering into this Arbitration Agreement, and you give up those procedural rights. Other rights that you would have if you went to court, such as the right to appeal and to certain types of discovery, may be more limited in arbitration. The right to appellate review of an arbitrator’s decision is much more limited than in court, and in general an arbitrator’s decision may not be appealed for errors of fact or law.


i. Severability. If any clause within this Arbitration Agreement, other than the Class Action Waiver clause above, is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that clause will be severed from this Arbitration Agreement, and the remainder of this Arbitration Agreement will be given full force and effect. If the Class Action Waiver clause is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then this entire Arbitration Agreement will be unenforceable and the Dispute will be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction.


j. Continuation. This Arbitration Agreement shall survive the termination of your contract with FlexFit and your use of the FlexFit Site, Classes and services.


### 19. Miscellaneous.


a. Choice of Law; Forum. These Terms shall be governed in all respects by the laws of the State of New York, without regard to conflict of law provisions, consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act (to the extent permitted by applicable law). If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration (including any claims brought by parties outside the United States), the dispute shall be exclusively brought in state or federal court located in New York, New York.


b. Assignment. We may assign our rights and obligations under these Terms. The Terms will inure to the benefit of our successors, assigns and licensees.


c. Severability. If any provision of these Terms shall be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision will be deemed severable from these Terms and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.


d. Headings. The heading references herein are for convenience purposes only, do not constitute a part of these Terms, and will not be deemed to limit or affect any of the provisions hereof.


e. Entire Agreement. These Terms and any applicable Additional Terms, as each may be amended as set forth herein, are the entire agreement between you and FlexFit relating to the subject matter herein.


f. Claims; Statute of Limitations.

h. Waiver. No waiver of any of these Terms by FlexFit is binding unless authorized in writing by an executive officer of FlexFit.

Further, in the event we choose to grant an exception to these Terms, any such exception is in our sole discretion and does not entitle you or anyone else to any exceptions in the future for similar circumstances.
