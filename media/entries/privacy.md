This Privacy Policy applies to you if you use our Site in the US.

The Site is not intended for or directed to persons under the age of 18, and we will not knowingly collect information from persons under 18. To provide information to us through registration or in any other manner on the Site, you must be 18 years of age or older.

### 1. What Does FitFlex Do?

FitFlex enables consumers (“FitFlex Users”) to find, book and attend a wide range of fitness, recreational and wellness classes, services, or products offered and operated by fitness studios, gyms, trainers, venues or other third parties through our platform ("Partners"). The FitFlex group companies operate all around the world.

### 2. What Personal Information Does FitFlex Collect?

We collect or receive personal information in a few different ways. Often, you choose what information to provide, but sometimes we require certain information in order for you to use, and for us to provide you with, the Site and the services you access through the Site.

Personal Information You Provide To Us.
There are a variety of different ways you may provide personal information to us, such as:

Account Creation. To create a FitFlex User account, you need to provide information such as your name, email address, phone number, sign-up city, and a password. If you make a purchase or sign up for a subscription, you will need to provide payment and billing information. You can choose to add further information to your account, such as birthdate, gender, photo, and address. If you are a FitFlex Partner we will ask for your name, address, phone number, email, credit card information, tax identification number, and information about your business, including the names of the instructors and individuals who provide your classes and services and the email addresses of authorized individuals on your account.
Posting and Uploading. We collect personal information from you when you provide, post, or upload it to our Site, such as when you respond to a survey or provide a class rating or review.
Communications Data. We may send transactional messages to you on behalf of, or initiated by, Partners or FitFlex Users. . For example, we may enable Partners to send text or in-app messages to FitFlex Users via our Site about an upcoming reservation. FitFlex receives data regarding such calls, texts, or other communications, including the date and time of the communication and its content.
Third-Party Data. If you are a FitFlex User, you should not provide information to us about someone else unless you have obtained the prior consent of the other person for us to receive and use their information, such as for emergency contact or referral purposes.
Personal Information Collected Automatically Through Your Use of the Site.
We log usage data when you visit or otherwise use our Site, such as when you view or click on content or ads (on or off our Site), perform a search, browse, schedule a reservation, and install or update one of our mobile apps. Specifically, the information we collect automatically may include information like internet protocol (“IP”) address, device type, unique device identification numbers, browser-type, broad geographic location (e.g., country or city-level location), language and marketing preferences and other technical information. We may also collect information about how your device has interacted with our Site, including the pages accessed and links clicked.
We may also collect precise geolocation data pertaining to your mobile device if you have consented to providing this to us through your device settings. We may use this information to provide, promote, and improve our services (for example, by showing you classes that are close to your location) and for related reasons, such as fraud prevention and security purposes. Please note that if you do not consent to providing your geolocation data, certain features of the mobile application may not work.
Personal Information Collected from Other Sources.
We may receive personal information about you from other sources, such as public databases, strategic and joint marketing partners, social media pages and platforms, people with whom you are friends or otherwise connected on social media platforms, as well as from other third parties. For example, where we make this available, you may choose to sync your FitFlex User account details with a third-party network, such as Facebook. If you do this, we will receive some of your Facebook account information. Exactly what information we receive will depend on your settings with the third-party network, but typically we receive your basic public profile information such as your username, email address, age range, gender, chosen language, country, friends list and any other public information.
Personal Information Collected from Partners.
Our Partners may choose to submit feedback to us about you regarding your use of their facilities or services.

## Cookie Notice

Last Updated: December 20, 2019

This Cookie Notice explains how FitFlex and its subsidiaries (collectively “FitFlex”, “ we”, “ us”, and “ ours” use cookies and similar technologies to recognize you when you visit our websites and use our mobile applications “Site”). It explains what these technologies are and why we use them, as well as your rights to control our use of them.

### What are cookies?

Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by website owners in order to make their websites work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information. Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, FitFlex) are called "first party cookies". Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called "third party cookies". Third party cookies enable third party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website (e.g. like advertising, interactive content and analytics). The parties that set these third-party cookies can recognize your computer both when it visits the website in question and also when it visits certain other websites.

### Why do we use cookies?

We use first party and third-party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our Sites to operate, and we refer to these as "essential" or "strictly necessary" cookies. Other cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our Websites. Third parties serve cookies through our Sites for advertising, analytics and other purposes. This is described in more detail below.

First and third-party cookies served through our Sites and the purposes they perform are described below:

Essential website cookies: These cookies are strictly necessary to provide you with services available through our Sites and to use some of its features, such as access to secure areas.
Performance and functionality cookies: These cookies are used to enhance the performance and functionality of our Sites but are non-essential to their use. However, without these cookies, certain functionality may become unavailable.
Analytics and customization cookies: These cookies collect information that is used either in aggregate form to help us understand how our Sites are being used or how effective our marketing campaigns are, or to help us customize our Sites for you.
Advertising cookies: These cookies are used to make advertising messages more relevant to you and they perform functions like preventing the same ad from continuously reappearing and in some cases selecting and displaying advertisements to you across the internet that are based on your interests.
Social networking cookies: These cookies are used to enable you to share pages and content that you find interesting on our Sites through third party social networking and other websites. These cookies may also be used for advertising purposes too.

### What about other tracking technologies?

Cookies are not the only way to recognize or track visitors to a website. We may use other, similar technologies from time to time, like web beacons (sometimes called "tracking pixels" or "clear gifs"). These are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enable us to recognize when someone has visited our Sites or opened an e-mail that we have sent them. This allows us, for example, to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within our Sites to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to our Sites from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, to improve site performance, and to measure the success of e-mail marketing campaigns. In many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to function properly, and so declining cookies will impair their functioning.

Our mobile applications may include third-party application software development kits that provide mobile performance and analytics data, bug reporting features, and APIs to third parties that help provide the Site, for social media functionality, and for marketing and advertising.

### Does FitFlex serve targeted advertising?

As described above, third parties may serve cookies on your computer or mobile device through the Sites to serve advertising. These companies may use information about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide relevant advertisements about goods and services that you may be interested in. They may also employ technology that is used to measure the effectiveness of advertisements. This can be accomplished by them using cookies or web beacons to collect information about your visits to this and other sites in order to provide relevant advertisements about goods and services of potential interest to you. The information collected through this process does not enable us or them to identify your name, contact details or other personally identifying details unless you choose to provide these.

### How can I control cookies?

You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies. You can exercise your cookie preferences for certain third-party cookies by clicking on the appropriate opt-out links provided above. You can also set or amend your web browser controls to accept or refuse cookies. If you choose to reject cookies, you may still use our Site though your access to some functionality and areas of our website may be restricted, you may worsen your overall user experience, since it will no longer be personalized to you and it may also stop you from saving customized settings like login information. As the means by which you can refuse cookies through your web browser controls vary from browser-to-browser, you should visit your browser's help menu for more information. To revoke consent, users may disable cookies by modifying their browser settings. The links listed below provide more information about what cookies are installed, how to allow, block or remove installation from your computer. Depending on which browser you use, the user may follow these links:

In addition, most advertising networks offer you a way to opt out of targeted advertising. If you would like to find out more information, please visit http://www.aboutads.info/choices/, https://www.networkadvertising.org/, or http://www.youronlinechoices.com. Please bear in mind that there are many more networks listed on that site than those that we use on our Website.

We use Google cookies for analytics and marketing purposes. You can opt-out of Google tracking through Google Ads Settings, Ad Settings for mobile apps, or any other available means. Google also provides a Google Analytics opt-out plug-in for the web.

### What is Do Not Track (DNT)?

DNT is a concept that has been promoted by regulatory agencies such as the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC), for the Internet industry to develop and implement a mechanism for allowing Internet users to control the tracking of their online activities across websites by using browser settings. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has been working with industry groups, Internet browsers, technology companies, and regulators to develop a DNT technology standard. While some progress has been made, it has been slow. No standard has been adopted to this date. As such, FitFlex does not generally respond to "do not track" signals.

### How often will this Cookie Notice be updated?

We may update this Cookie Notice from time to time in order to reflect, for example, changes to the cookies we use or for other operational, legal or regulatory reasons. Please therefore revisit this Cookie Notice regularly to stay informed about our use of cookies and related technologies.

The date at the top of this Cookie Notice indicates when it was last updated.
